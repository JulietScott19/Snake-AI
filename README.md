# Snake-AI
AI that plays snake game and tries to get high score

**The code in snake_game.py was provided for me**

I saved the weights and biases as checkpoints every 500 games
I used a neural network, my high score was 30 (I forgot to get a screenshot) 
I had 6 layers, a mix of dense and Leaky ReLU
I trained for 2000 iterations but the best score was around iteration 600
Ive learned that it would have been best to use a CNN and run it on my GPU
